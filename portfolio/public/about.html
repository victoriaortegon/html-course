<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Victoria, but my family calls me Vicky. I am a scientist in the biotechnology space. 
  I live in Austin, TX with my boyfriend Adam. I grew up in Corpus Christi, TX and frequent home when I can. 
  I don't have any pets, but I'd love to have a dog. My favorite color is lavender.

<p>I recently started learning how to be a web developer. I am currently in the 2023 Web Development bootcamp taught 
  by Dr.Angela Yu. I am really enjoying the course.</p>
